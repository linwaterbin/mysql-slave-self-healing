The current pt-slave-restart version is: v0.1 basing on Percona v2.2.15

Improvements and protocol version compliant new features
are added  as following:

v0.1 BuildTime:2015-10-19
  - new pattern
    error_number:1032
    error_msg:Could not execute Delete_rows event on table TB_NAME; Can't find record in '', 
              Error_code: 1032; handler error HA_ERR_KEY_NOT_FOUND;

  - change action skip
    - on RBR or MBR would execute slave_exec_mode=IDEMPOTENT instead of sql_slave_skip_counter
